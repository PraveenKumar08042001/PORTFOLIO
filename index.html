    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Hindustan Institute Of Technology and Science</strong>
            - Bachelor Of Technology,Electronics and Communication Engineering with CGPA of 8.88/10.0(till Semester 5)</li>
        <li><strong>Sri Chaitanya Junior College</strong>
        - Class 11 and 12 with a percentage of 93.4%</li>
        <li><strong>Sri Chaitanya Techno School</strong>
            - Class 10 with a percentage of 97%
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>AUTOMATIC SOAP DISPENSER USING ARDUINO</strong>
        -This Project is about Automatic soap dispenser using arduino,which can dispense soap/sanitizer automatically with the help of servo motors and it has timer of 20 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>VOICE CONTROLLED CAR USING BLUETOOTH</strong>
        -This Project is about controlling the car by voice with help of bluetooth(HC-05) module,arduino and L298N motor driver module.On the other end smart phone and a simple android app are used to control the car.</li>
        <li><strong>WALKING STEPS CALCULATOR</strong>
        -This Project is about walking steps calculator , made on the Arduino platform. The method used in this project is monitoring the acceleration vector of the device. For this purpose,  adxl345 accelerometer is interfaced with the Arduino. The number of steps walked by the user and the distance covered by him are displayed on an OLED screen. The logic used in this project can be easily replicated in a smartwatch application. The code logic can be easily ported to any other language as it simply reads the data from the accelerometer sensor and manipulates that data to detect the user movement</li>
        <li><strong>POPUP STORE</strong>
        -This Project is about POP-UP store, used Generarive Adverserial Networks to design an interface that creates images in all possible angles.This is a more effective way of generating new images as the nearest neighbor loss is minimal . This finds applications in online shopping app as it helps the user to analyze the outfit in various angles to buy them.</li>
    </ul>
